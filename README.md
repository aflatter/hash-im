hash-im
=======

Minimal telehash-based IM (command line).

Run this:
```
npm install
node im.js
```

Then it should have you connected and show you your hashname, you can type `/to dc375b4fc180d03fee8748ee71c2ec5c4d90bb63` and if I'm online (jer) you'll be connected in an encrypted p2p IM chat to me :)
